# Applied Machine Learning

This training hub covers Azure Machine Learning from fundamentals to production
operations, with formulas, architecture, deployment guidance, and visual references.

Progression model:

- Beginner: understand AI/ML fundamentals and platform basics.
- Intermediate: build data, training, and evaluation workflows.
- Advanced: deploy, monitor, debug, and govern production ML systems.

## Evolution of Machine Learning

Machine learning as a scientific field started in the 1950s, then moved through
multiple eras based on compute power, data availability, and algorithmic advances.

> **Note - How to read this timeline:** Each colored band is the *dominant paradigm* of an era, and the dots on the axis are the
> breakthroughs that triggered the next shift. Read it to see why modern Azure ML must support
> *both* classic ML (still best for tabular business data) and deep/foundation models (best for
> unstructured data) : the platform spans the whole history, not just the latest era.

### Milestone eras

1. Foundations (1950s-1970s): Turing test ideas, perceptrons, nearest-neighbor methods.
2. Expert systems era (1980s): rule-based AI in enterprise workflows.
3. Statistical ML era (1990s-2000s): SVMs, random forests, probabilistic modeling.
4. Deep learning era (2010s): GPUs and large datasets enabled deep neural networks.
5. Foundation model era (2020s+): transformers, large language models, multimodal AI.

### Why this matters for Azure ML learners

- It explains why modern MLOps includes both classic ML and deep learning workflows.
- It clarifies when simpler models can outperform larger neural models in tabular data.
- It frames current production needs: monitoring, governance, safety, and cost control.
